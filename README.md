# Sign Language Translator

## Overview  
The **Sign Language Translator** is a cutting-edge application designed to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing and speech impairments. This project leverages deep learning techniques to recognize hand gestures and translate them into text and audio in real-time, enabling seamless interaction between differently-abled individuals and others.

## Features  
- Real-time hand gesture recognition using deep learning models.  
- Converts recognized gestures into readable text and audible speech.  
- User-friendly interface for accessibility and ease of use.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Languages**: Python   
- **Deep Learning Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow/PyTorch  
- **Development Tools**: VS Code  

## Use Cases
- Aiding communication for the deaf and mute.
- Enhancing inclusivity in social and professional environments.
- Potential integration into education and training for sign language learning.

  ## Future Scope
  - Expanding gesture database to support more sign languages.
  - Improving model accuracy for diverse hand gestures.
  - Integrating additional features like translation to multiple languages.
